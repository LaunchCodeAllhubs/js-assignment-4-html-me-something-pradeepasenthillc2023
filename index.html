<h2>Planning </h2>
<p>
A one week road trip to the desert can be an exciting adventure. We chose our destination first and determined the best time to visit, especially the weather conditions. We checked the weather and climate conditions during the time we plan to travel. We considered the  factors such as extreme temperatures, rainfall, and peak tourist seasons.
</p>
<p>
Next we planned our route : Plotted out the driving route to the desert, considering the distance, driving time, and scenic attractions along the way. We researched attractions and activities like exploring national parks, visiting cultural sites, or experiencing local festivals or events.   
</p>
<p>
We booked accommodations in advance for 6 days and started packing essential clothing for the desert climate, including lightweight and breathable clothing, sun protection gear (hat, sunglasses, sunscreen), sturdy footwear, and layers for cooler nights, plenty of water, snacks, a first aid kit, navigation tools, and a map.

<h3>Day 2:Seven Magic Mountains and Hoover Dam</h3>
<p>
Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone's Seven Magic Mountains is a large-scale site-specific public art installation located near Jean Dry Lake and Interstate 15, approximately ten miles south of Las Vegas, Nevada. Comprised of seven towers of colorful, stacked boulders standing more than thirty feet high, Seven Magic Mountains is situated within the Ivanpah Valley adjacent to Sheep Mountain and the McCullough, Bird Spring, and Goodsprings ranges of mountains. A creative expression of human presence in the desert, Seven Magic Mountains punctuates the Mojave with a poetic burst of form and color.

<h3>Day 3: Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
      

<p>
Nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted. While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists, several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago. Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs, simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon.For thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans, who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves.

<h3>Day 4: Mojave National Preserve & Joshua Tree</h3>
           
<p>
The 20 million acres (81,000 km2; 31,000 sq mi) desert supports a number of human activities, including recreation, ranching, and military training. The Mojave Desert also contains various silver, tungsten, iron and gold deposits.Its desert climate is characterized by extreme variation in daily temperature, with frequent winter frosts, and average annual precipitation of 2 to 6 inches (50 to 150 mm). The most rain falls between November and April, with occasional snow accumulation in the mountains. Summer thunderstorms (called Monsoons) may bring sudden, heavy rainfall.The spiky Joshua Trees that populate this desert wonderland are an important part of the Mojave Desert ecosystem. They provide habitat for numerous birds, mammals, insects, and lizards.

Joshua tree forests tell a story of survival, resilience, and beauty borne through perseverance. One of the most remarkable facts about the Mojave Desert is that the presence of Joshua Trees also clearly indicates its boundaries as this remarkable plant doesn’t grow anywhere else!

<h3>Day 6: Santa Monica Pier</h3>
                
<p>
The Santa Monica Pier is over 100 years old. There is a legend that Elzie Crisler Segar, the author of the Popeye comic, met Olaf Olsen, a Norwegian sailor and the real-life inspiration for his comic book character Popeye, on the Santa Monica Pier. The Ferris wheel at Pacific Park was the first solar-power Ferris wheel. La Monica Ballroom that was opened on the pier in 1924 was the largest ballroom in America at that time. Hot Dog on a Stick has been sold on the Santa Monica Pier since 1946. Pacific Park - this amusement park is great for families. It has a solar-paneled Ferris wheel that is brightly lit. Some other rides that you can go on are the Simulator Thrill ride, Rollercoaster, and Sea Dragon.
Heal the Bay Aquarium - this aquarium is located beneath the Santa Monica Pier and it was opened in 1996. It is open to the general public and offers educational programs, activities, and special events dedicated to marine conservation, pollution prevention, and environmental education.
The Merry-Go-Round - this is an original carousel hippodrome from the 1920s.
The video arcade - an excellent place for children who can enjoy the video games by the water.
